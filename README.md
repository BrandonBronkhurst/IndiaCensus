# Census of India Analysis with SQL

This project involves analyzing the caste census of India using SQL queries. The data was sourced from an Excel file and imported into SQL tables for analysis. The project utilizes SQL to derive insights into population demographics, growth rates, sex ratios, and literacy rates.

## Key SQL Queries
1. **Row Count**: Determined the total number of rows in the datasets.
2. **State-Level Analysis**: Filtered data for states like Jharkhand and Bihar.
3. **Population and Growth**: Calculated the total population of India and average growth by state.
4. **Sex Ratio and Literacy**: Analyzed average sex ratio and literacy rate for each state.
5. **Top/Bottom States**: Identified top and bottom states based on growth, sex ratio, and literacy rate.
6. **Union Operator**: Compared top and bottom states in terms of literacy rates.
7. **Pattern Matching**: Selected states based on names starting with specific letters.
8. **Joins**: Joined datasets to analyze total males, females, literacy, and previous census population data.
9. **Population vs Area**: Compared population growth against total area.
10. **Window Functions**: Ranked districts by literacy rate to find the top 3 districts in each state.

## Achievements
- **Advanced SQL Techniques**: Utilized a range of SQL functions including aggregation, joins, pattern matching, and window functions.
- **Comprehensive Insights**: Provided detailed insights into population demographics, growth trends, and literacy rates across states and districts in India.

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL**: Core tool used for querying and analysis.
- **Excel**: Original dataset format.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to access SQL scripts.
2. Execute the SQL queries on your dataset to perform the analysis or adjust as needed.
